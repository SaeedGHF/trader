PC = CCP − PCP
PCS = 25-period EMA of PC
PCDS = 13-period EMA of PCS
APC = AVCCP − PCP
APCS = 25-period EMA of APC
APCDS = 13-period EMA of APCS
where:
PCDS = PC double smoothed
APCDS = Absolute PC double smoothed
PC = Price change
CCP = Current close price
PCP = Prior close price
PCS = PC smoothed
EMA = Exponential moving average
APC = Absolute PC
